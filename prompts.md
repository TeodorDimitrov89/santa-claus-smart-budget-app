### Prompt 1

Task: BMAD v6 Phase 1 (Analysis) for "Santa's Smart Budget App". Constraint: Automatically log every prompt and response summary to prompts.md.
Project Context (from Exam Brief): "Santa is preparing for Christmas, and managing the budget for gifts, elves, reindeer care, and holiday logistics has become a serious challenge. Build a web app that helps Santa manage expenses and income during the holiday season."
Functional Requirements:
    Manage Records (CRUD): Add, Update, and Delete income and expense records (e.g., Bonus, Salary, Gift Budget, Decorations, Travel).
    Categorize: Assign transactions to categories (e.g., Gifts, Food, Decorations, Travel, Charity, Santa's Workshop).
    Visualize: Display summaries and visual charts.
    AI Features (Optional): Provide AI-based spending suggestions.
Required Deliverables:
    prompts.md (active log).
    README.md (must include the original brief and setup instructions).
    summary.md (AI impact log).
Goal: Define the MVP and Functional Requirements. Initialize prompts.md and confirm the "Santa" theme is integrated into the analysis.

### Prompt 2

I choose Option A (Create a Product Brief).
BUT FIRST: You must execute your write_to_file tool right now to create prompts.md and log my previous prompt and this instruction. Do not proceed with the Product Brief until the file is initialized.
Once the file is created, proceed with the Product Brief for Santa's Smart Budget App using the requirements I provided. Make sure to include the "Santa" theme, CRUD operations, and the required deliverables (README, summary.md).

### Prompt 3

REMINDER ON LOGGING RULE: Before you update the Product Brief, you must fix prompts.md.
    Ensure prompts.md contains ONLY my exact prompts with Session Started at the beginning
    Remove any "Response summary" or extra text you previously added.
    From now on, append ONLY my instructions with Session Started at the beginning. This is a strict exam requirement.
Now, proceeding with Phase 1 - Step 02 (Vision)
Answers for the Product Brief:
    Core Problem: Santa needs to track a complex holiday budget (gifts, reindeer, elves) to avoid overspending.
    Primary User: Santa Claus (and his workshop managers).
    Success Criteria: A functional app where Santa can add/update/delete expenses, see them categorized, and view a chart of the remaining budget.
    What excites me: Creating a festive, AI-enhanced tool that ensures every child gets a gift because the budget is well-managed.

### Prompt 4

Current State: Santa uses messy paper ledgers and spreadsheets, which causes chaos when reindeer feed prices spike or elf overtime is needed.
The Gap: Generic apps lack the "North Pole" category structure and don't handle the extreme seasonal peak of December.
The Solution: A festive, simple-to-use app. The AI feature will focus on "Smart Alerts" (e.g., "Santa, you're overspending on Decorations; move budget to Gifts to save Christmas!").
Unfair Advantage: A tailored UI for the North Pole (Reindeer Care, Workshop Maintenance) that makes budgeting feel like part of the Christmas magic, not a chore.
Instruction:
Use this summary to COMPLETE the Product Brief and MVP definition now.
DO NOT ask more discovery questions.
Create the README.md draft with this "Santa Story" included.
Ensure prompts.md is updated with ONLY this prompt (no response summary)

### Prompt 5

Task: Finalize Phase 1 documentation with the following distribution of content.
1. Data Logic:
    Types: Income and Expense.
    Examples: Salary, Bonus (Income); Gift Budget, Decorations, Travel (Expense).
    Categories: Gifts, Food & Dinner, Decorations, Travel, Charity, Santa's Workshop.
2. Update Product Brief (_bmad-output):
    Move the Santa Claus fictional story and vision here. Use it to describe the problem and why this app is "magical" for the North Pole operations.
    Include the technical logic of Income/Expense/Categories.
3. Update README.md (Root):
    Project Brief: Keep this section technical and concise. Focus on the core features (CRUD, Charts, AI-based suggestions) and the tech stack.
    How to Run: Add a placeholder: "Instructions will be provided during the implementation phase."
4. Update summary.md (Strict Exam Format):
    Tasks used AI for: Requirements analysis, creative visioning (Santa story), and initial document structure.
    Output accepted/modified: Kept the creative vision in the Brief but cleaned up the README for professionalism; fixed the categorization logic.
    AI impact on speed/quality: Rapid generation of a compelling project context and technical templates.
    Custom settings: Instruction to log only user prompts in prompts.md.
    Problems handled: Re-organized the content to separate "storytelling" from "technical documentation" based on best practices.
5. Constraint: Append ONLY this prompt to prompts.md
