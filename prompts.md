### Prompt 2

I choose Option A (Create a Product Brief).
BUT FIRST: You must execute your write_to_file tool right now to create prompts.md and log my previous prompt and this instruction. Do not proceed with the Product Brief until the file is initialized.
Once the file is created, proceed with the Product Brief for Santa's Smart Budget App using the requirements I provided. Make sure to include the "Santa" theme, CRUD operations, and the required deliverables (README, summary.md).

### Prompt 3

REMINDER ON LOGGING RULE: Before you update the Product Brief, you must fix prompts.md.
    Ensure prompts.md contains ONLY my exact prompts with Session Started at the beginning
    Remove any "Response summary" or extra text you previously added.
    From now on, append ONLY my instructions with Session Started at the beginning. This is a strict exam requirement.
Now, proceeding with Phase 1 - Step 02 (Vision)
Answers for the Product Brief:
    Core Problem: Santa needs to track a complex holiday budget (gifts, reindeer, elves) to avoid overspending.
    Primary User: Santa Claus (and his workshop managers).
    Success Criteria: A functional app where Santa can add/update/delete expenses, see them categorized, and view a chart of the remaining budget.
    What excites me: Creating a festive, AI-enhanced tool that ensures every child gets a gift because the budget is well-managed.
